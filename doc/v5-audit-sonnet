I want you tobre read all GitHub scripts provided, and do another assessment of the end to end flow, and the current gaps in the implementation.
At present, script 2 fails to deploy, and you can see a mid flight deploy log here https://github.com/jgla1ne/AIPlatformAutomation/blob/main/doc%2Faudit-log.md

Present a complete set of recommendations for windsurf to implement this solution end to end, especially around script 2 so we can move to iterate with script 3
